# Ecommerce API

## Description

An eCommerce API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and protocols that allow different software applications to communicate and interact with an eCommerce platform. It provides a standardized way for developers to access and manipulate data and perform various operations on an online store.

An eCommerce API allows developers to access and retrieve data from the eCommerce platform's database. This includes information about products, categories, orders, customers, and more. Developers can fetch this data and use it in their applications to display product listings, customer information, or order details.

The API enables developers to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various entities within the eCommerce system. They can create new products, update existing product information, delete products, manage categories, process orders, and perform other essential tasks.
